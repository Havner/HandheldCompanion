# Fork info

This is an opinionated fork for my own use. Its aim is to limit the number of features, clean the code a little and increase performance. It might be broken, not work for you and is not supported in any way.

If for any reason you came here you're probably better of with the original Handheld Companion available [here](https://github.com/Valkirie/HandheldCompanion). 99% of the code here has been written by its original authors. Go buy them a beer! Links below.
